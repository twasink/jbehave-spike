Narrative:
In order to learn how to user JBehave better
As a developer of some middling-level of competence
I want to write some example stories about cooking bacon

Scenario: Cooking bacon in a frypan
Given 12 strips of bacon
And a frypan on a medium heat
When I put the bacon into the frypan
And wait for 10 minutes or until the bacon sizzles
And flip the bacon
And wait for 5 minutes
Then I get perfectly cooked crispy bacon
